## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Source Code

The comparators in each level are in the `src/comparator` folder, for example: `src/comparator/messageComparator.py `and `src/findings` define the structure of our findings.
The entry point is `src/cli/detect.py`.

## Set Up
1. Clone the repo
2. Copy the Git pre-commit hooks. This will automatically check the code, run tests, and perform linting before each commit.

```.sh
cp .githooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Running the tool

1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```.sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

2. Install the tool in the root directoty

```.sh
python3 -m pip install --editable .
```

3. Run proto-breaking-change-detector

```.sh
proto-breaking-change-detector --help
# Example usage1:
# Detect breaking changes for two versions proto API definition files in test/testdata/protos/enum
proto-breaking-change-detector test/testdata/protos/enum/v1 test/testdata/protos/enum/v1beta1 --human_readable_message

# Example usage2:
# Detect breaking changes for two versions proto API definition files defined in two directories.
# Custom the output Json file path and output human-readable messages to console.
touch breaking_changes.json

proto-breaking-change-detector test/testdata/protos/enum/v1,test/testdata/protos/message/v1 test/testdata/protos/enum/v1beta1,test/testdata/protos/message/v1beta1 --human_readable_message --output_json_path=breaking_changes.json
```

## Unit Tests

A single unit test can be run by this command: 

```sh
python -m unittest test.comparator.test_enum_comparator
```

All unit tests can be run by the following commands, we have all components covered by unit tests: 

```sh
python -m unittest discover test/comparator/
python -m unittest discover test/comparator/wrappers
python -m unittest discover test/detector
python -m unittest discover test/findings
python -m unittest discover test/cli
```

## Format Source Code

The source code can be format by `black` module:

```.sh
# Format source code
python -m black .
# Check without modifying the source code.
python -m black . --check
```
